Proposal
--------
We are going to build an Android application for NFC-capable phones/tablets that
will allow these devices to read specially-formatted NFC tags to send short
messages or notifications to residents living inside the corresponding dorm.

Plan
----
1. Learn Android
2. Learn how NFC works
3. Build the Android app
4. Learn about Google Cloud Messaging for Android push notifications
5. Build the server backend

Caveats
-------
We need to decide how to build our backend. For one, we need to choose a
language.

We might need a full physical machine or an virtual instance. If STWing cannot
provide one, we can easily deploy on Amazon EC2.

Deployment
----------
Initial plan is to introduce these tags to STWing, exclusively, to gather
interest.

If there is another interest, introduce it to the house.

Then we take over the world.
